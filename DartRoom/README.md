# Microsoft Mesh Toolkit Sample: DartRoom

![DartRoom](README/DartRoom.jpg)

## What is DartRoom?

The *DartRoom* project (scene: DartRoom) demonstrates the use of various basic features of Mesh.Physics within the Microsoft Mesh Toolkit
 for the creation of custom experiences.

In this project, you'll find:

* **Cups**: Simple objects to pick up.
* **Tables**: When grabbed, they try to align themselves with gravity.
* **Cupboards**: These should feel heavy. They use physics constraints.
* **Reset buttons** (red): Resets the transforms of a sub-scene.
* **Clock pendulums**: Powered by a physics hinge and velocity field.
* **Darts**: You can throw these in the camera direction. They're "sticky," so they'll stay attached to anything they hit.
* **Globe**: The globe rotates, demonstrating a motored hinge. The globe also has a gravity field which influences small objects entering a spherical trigger volume. Drag some cups close to the globe and watch them rotate around it like satellites.

This is a carefully designed scene that demonstrates the power of combining appealing visuals with the creative use of Mesh Physics features. Feel free to inspect and modify the scene and play with it!
