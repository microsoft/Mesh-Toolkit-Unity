# Mesh Toolkit for Unity

The Mesh Toolkit enables creators and developers to build custom 3D environments and experiences to meet specific business needs: new employee onboarding, training, guided tours, social gatherings, and more.This repo contains sample projects that you can use as a starting point for building your custom 3D experiences.  

## Getting started: 

For detailed instructions on getting started with development for Microsoft Mesh, [visit our documentation at learn.microsoft.com](https://aka.ms/MeshDeveloper).

1. [**Mesh 101**](https://aka.ms/Mesh101Tutorial): Start here to learn how to build for Mesh!

    ![A screenshot of the Mesh 101 tutorial showing the sphere terraces and wind turbines.](README/001-mesh-distant-shot.png)

1. [**Mesh 201**](aka.ms/Mesh201Tutorial): Explore more of the Mesh Toolkit to help along your journey while building for Mesh!

1. **Physics showcase projects**: Get things moving with physics in three example projects: a [dart room](https://aka.ms/MeshDartRoomSample), a [science building](https://aka.ms/MeshScienceBuildingSample), or a [physics effects gallery](https://aka.ms/MeshPhysicsEffectsSample).
