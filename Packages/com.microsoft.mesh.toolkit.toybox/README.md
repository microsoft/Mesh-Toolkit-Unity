Toybox is a Unity Engine package that empowers creators to build interactive experiences and games for Microsoft Mesh. This package provides visual scripts, assets, and shaders to help jumpstart creating activities for Mesh environments while staying within performance budgets.

1. Copy and paste the com.microsoft.mesh.toolkit.toybox folder located in this repository's Packages folder into your project's Packages folder.
2. Reference the Toybox package from GitHub.

The Toybox package will now be installed in your Unity project as a package in the project's Packages folder with the name Microsoft Mesh Toolkit Toybox. You can now start using prefabs and visual scripts within the Toybox runtime folder.
